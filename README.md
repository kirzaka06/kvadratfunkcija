# KVADRÄ€TFUNKCIJA
## What?
It means "square function" when translated directly. It's what we call a function that draws parabola's.
## Install
`./build.sh -r -p` <br>
That's all. Needs `SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, gcc` afaik. <br>
Open issue if there are any errors.
## Why?
Because I wanted to, simple.<br>
Honestly it's not good but I don't really care. Was fun making it
